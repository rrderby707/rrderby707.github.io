Our juniors team is open to anyone younger. We play women's flat track roller derby competitively. Our practices and scrimmages are available to people of all gender identities.\r\n        <br /><br />\r\n        Getting Started<br />\r\n        Getting started with Resurrection Roller Derby is easy. If you're ready to find your new favorite hobby, develop lifelong bonds and discover the best fitness program around, all you have to do is show up. RRD hosts Skater Intake nights the first Tuesday of every month at our home rink, Cal Skate in Rohnert Park. After your first night you'll be welcome at all of our Tuesday night practices. No experience is necessary and your first session is free. After that sessions are $10 each, or $30/month. If you aren't sure, feel free to stop in and see what this sport is all about. Even if you've never been on wheels before, we can get you game ready in no time. Loaner gear is available for free. We also host intensive Boot Camp programs, usually during the summer and in January. Watch our Facebook page for details and the most up to date information.\r\n        <br /><br />\r\n        Next Steps<br />\r\n        When you've attended training and feel ready for it, you can try out for the league at any time. Tryouts are based on the requirements of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA). Passing the minimum skills test is required for playing full contact (which we know you're excited to do!).\r\n        <br /><br />\r\n        New skaters who pass tryouts will be placed into our recreational league, where you can practice full contact and attend regular training. This environment allows you to learn at your own pace, and gives you a chance to make sure you're comfortable with the time commitments necessary to succeed. Once you're ready, you can apply to join the competitive teams. If you aren't able to commit to a solid practice and bout schedule you can remain a rec skater for as long as you need, enjoying the sport with no commitments at a price less than most gym memberships.\r\n        <br /><br />\r\n        Gear<br />\r\n        The minimum gear required includes roller skates, helmet, mouth guard, elbow pads, wrist guards and knee pads. We can loan you everything you need. Inexpensive mouth guards are also available. If you're showing up for your first Basics Night you just need some comfortable clothing, a water bottle and yourself. As you progress we're happy to provide advice on specific gear. We have access to Cal Skate's pro shop to help get you going. Our rink stocks a variety of safety gear, and the experts will happily talk equipment with you.\r\n        <br /><br />\r\n        Want to Learn More?<br />\r\n\r\n        If you'd like to know more about what to expect and maybe a bit about roller derby in general, check out the WFTDA page here: <a href=\"https://wftda.com/new-fans/\" target=\"_new\">Roller Derby 101</a>.
